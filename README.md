# Wordle Clone
This repo contains a simple HTML page with a clone from the [New York Times wordle game](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

# How to run
You simply open the [index.html](./index.html) or the [wordle.html](./wordle.html) file in your browser.
Or you run a simple http server in the root folder of the repo e.g. (in python) `python -m http.server`
